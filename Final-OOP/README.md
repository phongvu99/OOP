# Final-OOP

# TLDR;
- Download, extract, open project folder in intelliJ, set path for "loginController.java", "dancingController.java", "ReportRead.java", "ReportWrite.java" and "plotController.java".
- Profit.

# What you need:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Community Edition or ULTIMATE) (Doesn't matter which one you have). 
- Your brain.
- 5-10 mins depending on how well you are with IntelliJ.
- An open-minded.
- A cup of coffee.

# How to run the project:
- Download "ProjectEden.zip".
- Extract it to a folder, preferably non-system folder.
- Open "IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition" or "IntelliJ IDEA". 
- File->Open (Menu bar, in a project).
- Open in the main window (no project).
- In the new window, go to the folder where you've extracted the .zip file.
- Open that folder by clicking OK (In this case, its name is "Project Eden").
- To the right, you can see 1:Project tab, click on it.
- You should have a Tree View, from there, src->NaughtyBitch->loginController.
- Open it by double-click, then scroll down to "private void getCredentials()" function.
- You should have something called: File myFile = new File(pathname: "blah blah blah") in the function.
- Edit the path to your path using the given template.
- Do the same for "dancingController.java", "ReportRead.java", "ReportWrite.java" and "plotController.java" (Set path for "video.mp4", "data.txt" and "report.txt" respectively.
- That should do the trick.
- Now go to Main.java file.
- The same thing, 1.Project.
- From there, src->NaughtyBitch->Main.
- Open Main.
- Press Ctrl+Shift+F10.
- Have a cup of coffee if you are using a potato laptop or PC.
